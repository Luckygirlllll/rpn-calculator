# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

1. This is RPN calculator written on React. I used stack in order to implement logic of calculator.
2. I decided to use React because it's the most popular web framework right now. 
   All UI elements are reusable components.
3. If I would have more time I would also add tests to the app.
4. To run app do: npm install && npm start
